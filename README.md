# Diwali Data Analysis

This group of data provides sales information from a store that sells products during the Indian celebration of Diwali. The data consists of details about the items sold, their categories, the channels of distribution, sale prices, and the total number of items sold. 

To enhance consumer satisfaction and sales, a project is being undertaken to analyse Diwali sales data. This project required the use of the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and manipulation. Through this initiative, we were able to identify potential clients across various states, occupations, genders, and age groups, improving the customer experience. Additionally, we determined which product categories and specific products were the best sellers. This information was used to plan inventories and satisfy customer demand, which ultimately increased sales.
